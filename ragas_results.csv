1. **Gelişmiş Hafıza**: Seer iksirini içenler başlangıçta hafızalarında hafif bir artış yaşarlar ve bu hafıza zamanla iksirin sindirilmesiyle daha da gelişir. Bu gelişmiş hafıza, Seer'a çeşitli Ritüel Büyü ve Kehanet Sanatlarının adımlarını ezberleme ve öğrenme yeteneği kazandırır.

2. **Spiritüalite**: Seer'ın spiritüalitesi iksiri içtikten sonra gelişir.

3. **Ruh Görüşü**: Seer, Ruh Görüşü'nü kullanarak hayaletler ve ruhlar gibi fiziksel olmayan şeyleri görebilir. Bir ruhun farklı parçalarını görebilir, bir kişinin sağlığını ve duygularını çıkarabilir ve bir şeyin büyülü bir auraya sahip olup olmadığını belirleyebilir. Gizlenmiş nesneleri ""görebilir"" ve hafif ayak seslerini ""duyabilir"", böylece önceden yargıda bulunabilir. Ancak, görsel, işitsel ve dokunsal duyuları herhangi bir gelişme göstermez.

4. **Kehanet Sanatları ve Ritüel Büyü**: Seer, astroloji, ruhsal sayılar ve kristal küre gibi çeşitli Kehanet yöntemlerinde ustalaşabilir ve Ritüel Büyü konusunda bir Gizem Araştırmacısı'ndan daha bilgili hale gelebilir. Ancak, bu mistik sanatları doğrudan kullanma bilgisine sahip olmazlar; sadece bu sanatlarda uzmanlık seviyesinde yetenek ve kabiliyet kazanırlar. Ustalıkları, öğrenme sürelerine bağlıdır.

5. **Tehlike Sezgisi**: Seer, spiritüalitesini kullanarak tehlikeyi sezgisel olarak algılayabilir.","Seer potionunu içenler hafıza artışı, Spirituality gelişimi, Spirit Vision (ruhani görüş), Divination Arts & Ritualistic Magic yetenekleri ve Danger Intuition (tehlike sezgisi) kazanır.",1.0,1.0,0.9035853899815677,0.99999999998
